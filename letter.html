        <p>Let me gather the courage to say things in front of you!</p>

        <p>
          As I sit down to write this letter, I'm filled with excitement and
          nerves, but most of all, with love for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the moment we met (2016), your beauty and charm captured my heart. Your
          laughter is contagious, and your kindness knows no bounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          But beyond your outward appearance, it's your inner beauty that i tryly
          sets you apart. Your kindness, compassion, and unwavering strength
          inspire me every single day. You have a heart of gold, and it's
          evident in the way you care for those around you.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's something else, too, something that might seem unconventional
          to mention in a letter like this, but I believe it's an important part
          of who you are. sometimes I maybe get angry because of your behaviour but 
          it's just an passing cloud my love for you is like the sky which last'
          forever
        </p>

        

        <p>
          Please keep smiling and never forget im the one of the people who care's
          about you and always prays for your happiness wherever you go whatever you do.....
        </p>

        <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>

        <p class="center">your's&hellip;</p>
